# Databricks Basics

This folder contains essential information about Databricks ‚Äî what it is, how it works, and how it's commonly used in data engineering and analytics.

## üìå What is Databricks?

Databricks is a unified, cloud-based platform for big data analytics and artificial intelligence (AI). It combines the best of data lakes and data warehouses into a **Lakehouse architecture**, enabling efficient data processing, analytics, and machine learning.

It is built on top of **Apache Spark** and integrates seamlessly with cloud services like **Azure**, **AWS**, and **Google Cloud**.

## üèóÔ∏è Databricks Architecture

Here's a simplified view of Databricks architecture:

### 1. **Workspace**
A collaborative environment where notebooks, libraries, dashboards, and jobs are created and shared among team members.

### 2. **Clusters**
Managed Spark clusters used to run your data workloads. These are auto-scalable and can be terminated when not in use.

### 3. **Delta Lake**
An open-source storage layer that brings ACID transactions and schema enforcement to your data lake. Delta Lake is a core part of Databricks‚Äô Lakehouse architecture.

### 4. **Databricks Runtime**
A versioned runtime environment based on Apache Spark, optimized for performance, stability, and compatibility.

### 5. **Jobs**
Automated pipelines or scheduled executions of notebooks and workflows.

### 6. **Data Sources**
Supports diverse data formats and cloud storage like:
- Azure Blob / Data Lake Storage
- AWS S3
- Google Cloud Storage
- JDBC/ODBC connections
- REST APIs

### 7. **Notebooks**
Interactive notebooks (supporting Python, SQL, Scala, and R) for coding, visualizations, and documentation.
